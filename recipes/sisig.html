    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Sisig is a flavorful Filipino dish of crispy pig parts, onions, chiles, and citrus. It's often made with pork jowl, ears, belly, and chicken liver. The dish is usually seasoned with calamansi, a small green citrus fruit that tastes like a cross between lime and orange. </p>
    <p>As a Filipino, this is also one of my favorite Filipino dishes</p>
