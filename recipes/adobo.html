    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Adobo is a classic Filipino dish typically made with meat (usually chicken or pork) that's marinated and slowly cooked in a flavorful sauce primarily composed of vinegar, soy sauce, garlic, black peppercorns, and bay leaves, resulting in tender meat with a rich, savory, and slightly tangy taste; it's often served with a side of rice and considered a staple in Filipino cuisine.</p>
    <p>This would definitely be in my Top 3 Filipino dishes</p>
